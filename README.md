## Background

**üöÄ Join [Mattermost's AI discussion forums](https://forum.mattermost.com/c/ai-frameworks/40) and the ["AI Exchange" community server channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ai-exchange) where Mattermost's open source community is sharing the latest AI resources and innovations!**

The LLM extensions plugin adds functionality to use and develop LLMs (like from OpenAI or Hugging Face) within Mattermost. 

This plugin is currently experimental. More options and the ability to use local LLMs is on the roadmap. Contributions and suggestions are welcome, [see below](#contributing)!

1. Clone and enter this repository:
  * `git clone https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-ai && cd mattermost-plugin-ai`
2. Create a `.env.docker` file inside a `mattermost` folder.
   - You can adjust this accordingly based on the environment variables you see in the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file.
3. Start the services:
  * `docker compose up -d`
4. Configure the Mattermost server from the init script:
  * `bash ./init.sh`
5. Install `mattermost-plugin-ai` on Mattermost from the command line:
  * `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065 MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=root MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD> make deploy`
6. Access Mattermost and configure the plugin:
  * Open Mattermost at `http://localhost:8065`

  * Enable the plugin and configure plugin settings as desired.

For example, you can configure your OpenAI API key and allowed teams/users as desired.

## Usage

### Thread Summarization
Use the post menu or the `/summarize` command to get a summary of the thread in a DM:

### Chat anywhere
Just mention @ai anywhere in Mattermost to ask it to respond. It will be given the context of the thread you are participating in:

### React for me
Just for fun! Use the post menu to ask the bot to react to the post. It will try to pick an appropriate reaction.

### RLHF Feedback Collection
Bot posts will have üëç üëé icons that will later be used to collect feedback for RLHF fine tuning. The idea would be to use this as input for RLHF fine tuning.
