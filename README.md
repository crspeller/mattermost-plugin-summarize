### React for me
Just for fun! Use the post menu to ask the bot to react to the post. It will try to pick an appropriate reaction.

### RLHF Feedback Collection
Bot posts have üëç üëé icons that collect user feedback. The idea would be to use this as input for RLHF fine tuning or prompt development.
